Our privacy policy is closely aligned with our philosophy on free speech, free press, and the right to anonymity.
<br><br>
We log only amount of bandwidth you use, not URLs, content or anything else about how you use your accounts.
<br><br>
We don't track what you do with your VPN/proxy services. We don't sell your data or personal info, even if you provide it.
<br><br>
If you use one of our free products or services, we don't collect any information about you.
<br><br>
If you use our support system or community forums, those systems ask for an email address in order to notify you of replies. You are encouraged to use a disposable email address for this purpose, although we will never share or sell that address, give it to a 3rd party unless required by law, nor send any emails to it except reply notifications.
<br><br>
If you use one of our paid services, we collect the minimum information possible in order only to bill you. For example, we cannot bill a credit card without a name. If we did collect billing information from you, that information (except your email address) is not stored by us. It is stored by our payment provider, Recurly. Their privacy policy is here. We also accept digital currencies (bitcoin, ethereum, etc) if you'd prefer not to divulge any information about yourself. Contact us for wallet addresses since we are not integrated with our payment processor's digital currency system.
<br><br>
If you use one of our paid services, we ask for an email address. You are encouraged to use an anonymous email address. We use this email address only to provide you with account information, and to alert you of changes to your account information.
<br><br>
If we did collect minimal billing information from you during checkout, we will never share or sell it. We will never give it to a 3rd party unless required by law. We will never market to you directly unless you expressly opt-in when making a purchase or when setting the marketing preference in the control panel. Once again, if we did collect billing information from you, that information (except your email address) is not stored by us. It is stored by our payment processor, Recurly.

We have designed our Privacy Policy and our Data Usage Policy consistent with the following principles (based on the Creative Commons privacy policy):
<br><br>
Privacy policies and data collection and use policies will be human readable, comprehensive, and easy to locate
<br><br>
Only the minimum amount of information necessary to provide you with services will be collected and maintained, and only for so long as reasonably needed or required
<br></br>
Information you provide through our Websites, or that we gather as a result of your use of our Websites, will not be used for marketing or advertising purposes, nor will it be provided voluntarily (without your permission) to anyone else unless required by United States law
<br><br>
Unless restricted or prohibited by United States law, and provided your email address has been collected and retained, you will be notified when circumstances require Ghost browser to provide a third party with your personal information.
<br><br>
<h3>The Policy</h3>

Except as required by United States court order, Ghost browser:
<br><br>
* will not track, store or transmit to any server or third party, information regarding users' data (including web browsing activity and behavioral data)
<br><br>
* will not sell or otherwise work with third parties to market additional software to users
<br><br>
* will not deliver or help others deliver any targeted advertising to users
<br><br>
* will not store users' passwords and login credentials except those issued by Ghost browser VPN/proxy services
<br><br>
Please note: Ghost browser's policy is required by law, not permitted by law, since permitted means almost anything is allowed, Required by law means situations where company executives receive a valid United States court order and is compelled to comply or face prison and/or fines.
